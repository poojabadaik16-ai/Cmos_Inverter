## 📌 Key Highlights

- **✅ Schematic Design**  
  Designed a CMOS inverter using PMOS and NMOS transistors to explore basic digital switching behavior.

- **✅ DC Transfer Analysis**  
  Performed a DC sweep to observe the **Vout vs Vin** characteristics and determine the switching threshold and noise margins.

- **✅ Transient Simulation**  
  Simulated time-domain response to verify logic inversion, output transitions, and signal integrity.

This project reinforces concepts of **digital logic design**, **CMOS operation**, and **signal behavior** in time and voltage domains.
